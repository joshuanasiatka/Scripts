# RDP Checker (for server reboots)
#### Joshua Nasiatka (Mar 2017)

Continuously ping server until it comes back up after a reboot and alerts when RDP is available. There is an option to automatically start an RDP session once port 3389 is restored.

Script can be compiled to exe with [Bat2Exe](http://www.f2ko.de/en/b2e.php).

### Changelog
[*Version 1.0*](RDPChecker.ps1) - Created the GUI application
